# Privacy policy

barrystats only collects data to provide core product functionality. No data are collected without explicit consent: data are only collected for players who have deliberately allowed third party services to access their public match data within the DotA 2 client. The following potentially personally identifiable information is collected and stored for players:

* Steam account name
* Steam account avatar

These data are sourced from the [Steam Web API](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Web_API). They are encrypted at transfer, stored on barrystats' database servers, and authorized access to a subset of the data is provided through the barrystats API and presented in the barrystats app interface.

No user behaviour is recorded and no data are shared with third parties.

It is possible that this privacy policy will change over time as the product evolves. If you have any questions regarding privacy or data collection, feel free to reach out to privacy@barrystats.gg
